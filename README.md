# Module Introductions
## Overview
This Image Picker is developed and re-encapsulated based on QBImagePicker, MWPhotoBrowser, VIMVideoPlayer, LLSimpleCamera and the Photokit Sample Code by WWDC. You can find these librarys on Github. I did some customized modification to them in order to avoid some conflicts with your existing project. You can safely import VIMVideoPlayer and LLSimpleCamera if you already have them in your project. QBImagePicker and MWPhotoBrowser have been totally modified and minimized into some parts of this whole project.
